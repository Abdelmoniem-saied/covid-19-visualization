# 🦠 COVID-19 Visualization Project

A data visualization project using **Python** to analyze and explore the global impact of COVID-19 using real-world data.

## 📌 Project Overview

This project loads COVID-19 data from `worldometer_coronavirus_summary_data.csv`, then generates multiple visualizations using **Matplotlib**, **Pandas**, and **NumPy**, including:

✅ Line Charts (Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered per Continent)  
✅ Multiple Subplots Comparison  
✅ Histogram (Cases per 1M Population)  
✅ Scatter Plot (Tests vs Confirmed Cases)  
✅ Bar Charts with Custom Ticks & Labels  
✅ Legends, Spacing & Layout Formatting
